Grading Rubric:
based on correctness + late penalty based on the syllabus
Due time: July 3, 11:59 pm
How to submit: please submit it to black board. 

A:
1) For slides page 14 (chapter 6,) of "Algorithm for Process Pi", it is talking about the Peterson’s Solution. 
Explain step by step for the code shown in page 14 about why the Peterson’s Solution can preserve Mutual exclusion. (20 points)
You should use two cases to explain: 
case 1: step by step of Pi's using critical section process when Pj is not in the critical section. 
case 2: step by step of Pi's using critical section process when Pj is in the critical section. 
2) What is reorder? (5 points)
3) For page 19 of chapter 6, explain why reorder will destroy Mutual exclusion. (10 points)


B:  
1) What is the relationship between Semaphore and Mutex? (10 points)
2) P37 of chapter 6, step by step explain why the semaphore can make sure S1 to happen before S2. (10 points)
3) P58 of chapter 6, explain why P0 and P1 are deadlocked? (10 points)

C: (15 points)
Page 5 and page 6 of chapter 7, explain the Bounded-Buffer producer and consumer process.


D: (20 points)
1) Page 13 of chapter 7, "Dining-Philosophers Problem Algorithm", may we have deadlock for this algorithm? If so explain the detail when we have 5 Philosophers
